The CIA uses cryptonyms to conceal the identity of assets, people, places, and other sensitive entities in documents. Cryptonyms may begin with a two character digraph or prefix. The digraph can group cryptonyms by a region, location, operation, or other purpose.

Using cryptonyms in sensitive communications is a simple tradecraft technique and is most effective when combined with other practices such as compartmentalization and encryption.

## Examples

The Mary Ferrell Foundation maintains a [database](https://www.maryferrell.org/php/cryptdb.php) of known CIA cryptonyms. The following is an example usage of a cryptonym:

> IF SHIPMENT NOT ALREADY EN ROUTE, PLS FORWARD TO JMWAVE SOONEST.

This is a quote from a [cable](https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=32627#relPageId=2) referencing `JMWAVE`. The digraph `JM` is for Cuba and `WAVE` refers to the Miami Station.
